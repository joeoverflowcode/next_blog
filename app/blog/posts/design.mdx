summary: 'In today's market, does learning to design set you apart from the competition?'

I initially started coding without really considering what type of assets I would be using on my projects. As I leaned more into the specialization of web development I realized that the use of images is paramount in order to have great looking design. From making logos, watermarks, icons, hero images etc... I did not know how deep this rabbit hole would go the more things I created. 

Out of need, I signed up for Canva and have primarily using it's premium services for all of my web designs. I know at a certain point I will need more than what they offer and may need to look into Photoshop. For now it will suffice. 

I sometimes find myself separating my working session as coding sessions vs design sessions. Most of my time is spent coding but on the days I need to design images, it requires a whole different set of skills and a different part of my brain. 

I'm not sure if this skill is helping with my coding but it has helped me identify what type of assets would be good to use in certain situations. The more that I create and experiment the more that I learn. I'm enjoying the projects that require a higher degree of design. It really shows me the true pain points of web development.
