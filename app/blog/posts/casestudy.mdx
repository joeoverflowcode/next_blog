summary: 'Approaching Case Studies'

Some feedback I've consistently been receiving when showing my portfolio is my lack of case studies. Coming out of my bootcamp and coding on my own for a few months now, I had never once heard about case studies or what they were. I took a few days to approach what they were and what elements they were comprised of. Not only do I need to learn what a case study actually is but I then in turn have to learn how to present and style it via React components. This is an exciting challenge. Learning about something completely new and then trying to design it with elements I should already have experience with. 

When I think about it like this, I then see the possibility of making a 'Case Study' out of a 'Case Study'. In short, approaching learning something specific from a scientific approach with defined objectives, plans and outcomes. 

Within the next few days I suspect I will be either designing a case study to fit into my portfolio or designing a new portfolio based around case studies.
