When I look back at my progress of learning web development, I'm surprised at how much it has changed. I had taken a few computer education classes in school and knew some HTML but now several years later it has slowly evolved into something bigger. What's interesting is that as far as how complex some of the modern frameworks have come, *the overall basic concepts are still there*. 

## I see the tech landscape as a race amongst all these frameworks and technologies to provide the most optimal way of creating software and websites.
I'm not sure if this is correct but this is the overall feeling I've gathered in the past few months.
 Each language will have various ecosystems and languages depending on what you want to build. Frameworks competing on efficiency and scalability. *Is Next.js is the best framework out there?* There seems to be enough buzz around it and it has provided some decent tools for deployment so I'm going to keep diving further for the time being.

At the end of the day I want to see if this framework really is a tool I can see a business using in order to manage their web presense. I'm probably still too soon to tell and I have many hours of development and production ahead of me.
