summary: 'Arriving in Mexico and finding a way to code while traveling'
---

I arrived in Mexico 3 days ago and this is the first chance I've gotten to open my terminal window.

I had intentions to finish some code while waiting for my flight in DFW but sure enough that didn't happen. The weather has been on and off rain since I arrived so with the rain comes the poor internet connection. Even though you may be stuck inside, with a poor internet connection, it makes coding very challenging, not necessarily the coding part but all the reference material you have to access just to make a single change. 

I've managed to get around town and find the essentials I need to get by.

- food ✅ 
- water ✅ 
- coffee ✅

## The toughest part now was to find that golden opportunity while the weather is nice out (so I have internet) and to have enough discipline to avoid the beach, sit down and open VS Code. 

I'm not sure if updating my blog counts as coding but I'm going to chalk this one up as a W. If Github counts it, I count it. There's a Corona out there waiting for me and I got to go track it down.
