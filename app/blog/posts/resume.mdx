summary: 'How I've been updating my resume'
---

My resume has been an evolving document for the past several months. As I start and or accomplish things in a professional sense, will require me to make modifications to a resume. After a while, these modifications can add up and may require me to create new sections and or consider alternate formats. 

It's best to start from a template or a guide that has been proven to be effective. From there make the template fit your background and credentials. In the last month I've had several critiques that have been helping me format my resume more effectively. *The objective is always to create something clear and concise.*

I plan to take my resume to meetup this week and get even more feedback on it. My goal is to show it to at least 3 peers and get their opinions on it. Ideally I can hand my resume to any other professional in the future with a document outlining my credentials as a potential candidate for employment.
