summary: 'How I've been updating my resume'
---

##  My resume has been an evolving document every few weeks. The more that I
accomplish in a professional sense, will require me to make modifications. After a while, these modifications can add up and may require me to create new sections and formats. It's best to start from a template or a guide that has been proven to be effective. From there make you personal fit and match the template. In the last month I've had several critiques that have been helping me format my resume more effectively. The key is to create something clear and concise. 

I plan to take my resume to meetup this week and get even more feedback on it. My goal is to show it to at least 3 peers and get their opinions on it. Ideally I can hand my resume to any other professional in the future with a document outlining my credentials as a potential candidate for employment.
