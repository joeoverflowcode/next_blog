*Dogfooding* (or "eating your own dog food") refers to the practice of using one's own products or services in real-world scenarios. This technique serves various purposes, including testing, quality control, and promotion of the products or services in question.

## One way I've learned to debug my code and live products is to *actually use them*. As I build out my portfolio, I've found it useful to use my own portfolio as my homepage whenever I open up a browser. Everytime I open it, I critique the design and make mental notes for the next time I sit down to code. 

This technique has served as well as a way to self-motivate. If I get sick of looking at a particular feature or even an entire project that means it's time to get to code.
