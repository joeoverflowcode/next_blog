## The idea of learning something completely new is daunting for any person. 
Regardless of your age or background, as humans, we tend to resist learning new things. I think from a neurological sense, our brain recognizes learning as an expenditure of energy and resources, especially the resources going to the brain and thus will give us an instinctual reaction to keep away from learning. Simply put, the brain does not want to take up any unnecessary resources to learn something new.

## Young or old, complex or simple - when our brain sees learning, we become adverse to it.

It's challenging learning something new at any point in life, one of the best ways I've dealt with this challenge is with a method of gentle exposure over a prolonged period of time. Focusing more on repeated consistent habits vs brute force. 

## Learning to code is not simple or easy
It takes a lot of persiverence and determination to consistently sit down and expose yourself to new concepts everyday. Challenging as these tasks are, in the end the rewards can be fulfilling. Although you may not see much change within a day or sometimes even a week, when you look back over a longer period of time you will certainly see some measurable progress, as long as you don't quit. 

*Just keep learning!*
