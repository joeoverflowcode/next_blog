summary: 'How to network with other developers'

Networking is not easy, I'm referring to networking in the business sense. 

By definition networking is *"The practice of building relationships with individuals and businesses for professional purposes. It involves the strategic exchange of information and resources to create connections that can be mutually beneficial."*

Just finishing the last few words of that definition can be difficult for most. It's not easy to put yourself out there by defining, categorizing and exposing who and what you are. This is another survival skill that I've come to find is necessary to make it in the tech space. 

Recently I have been attending more and more developer meetups and have started to collaborate with some of them. As a beginner, I remain open to feedback and critique as I hone in on my skills. Even though it's not easy at first, it is important that we embrace networking in order to progress our career.
