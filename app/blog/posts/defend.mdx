 One can teach you how to design a great back-end or make captivating front-end component but one thing I've come to find out while in tech is nobody can or will teach you how to take in feedback given to us by our peers.

It's not an easy obstacle for many, as you pour painstaking hours into aligning an image just right only to be told that it doesn't look that good. To hack away a server file only to be told that it could of been optimized a different way. When we take critiques it can sometimes feel like an attack on us personally. As a painter that devotes countless hours on their work, developers too can grow very attached to the works they create. 

The tech space is very competitive and people who can align squares and organize arrays seem like they are coming a dime a dozen. As I continue my journey I learn to loosen up my personal ego and embrace any feedback I can get. More times than not, after some time has passed to process, I usually feel inspired to code some more. Maybe try something new or tackle the same problem but with a different approach. 

This journey is not easy but it can be humbling. As we progress I think it's better for us to be seeking out criticism instead of praise.
