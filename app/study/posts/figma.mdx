## Introduction
This case study examines the time required to learn the fundamentals of Figma, a popular design tool, to effectively integrate UI/UX principles with coding in React JavaScript frameworks. My objective is to reduce the guesswork in design systems and bring components closer to front-end code. Understanding this learning process is crucial for optimizing design and development workflows, enhancing productivity, and fostering better collaboration within teams.

## Problem Statement
For individuals with basic coding skills, understanding the time and effort needed to achieve proficiency in Figma is essential. This case study aims to identify the learning curve, pinpoint common challenges, and provide actionable insights to bridge the gap between design and development.

## Background
I completed a 4-month, in-person, coding bootcamp focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. Proceeding the bootcamp, I spent 6 months independently learning modern front-end technologies like Tailwind CSS, Aceternity UI, and deploying projects using frameworks such as Next.js.

1. *Training Program*: I will be attempting to complete a Portfolio design from scratch following an intermediate/advanced tutorial.
2. *Time Tracking*: I will be devoting a minimum of 40 hours a week in order to ensure realistic time frames of completion. My current hypothesis is that it will take me around 2 full weeks.
3. *Assessment*: I expect to have a completed Figma Portfolio project by the date of August 12th.
4. *Training Program*: The program will have no formal education framework aside from following a tutorial. When I experience a section I do not understand, I will seek out independent excerpts of information in order to fill in my proficiency. 
5. *Time Tracking*: I will log my hours daily in order to maintain accurate gauge of time completed.
6. *Assessment*: I will take a snapshot of the completed work on August 12th. If completed earlier, please note the day of completion
